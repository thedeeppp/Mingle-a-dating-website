                <h1>Endless Possibilities</h1>
                <p>With more than 55 billion matches to date, we’re no stranger to bringing singles together online. Some
                    sites, like Hinge and eharmony, are designed for long-term relationships, but on the Tinder app, we’re

            <h1>Roll With Us Anywhere</h1>
            
            
            <p>When you want to meet local people whether you’re visiting New York City or Chicago, there’s an app for
                that—and it’s called Tinder. Chat with people near and far with features that let you match around the
                world. Tinder is your go-to travel buddy. We’ve got you covered in 190 countries, and not even our friends
                at OKCupid and Plenty of Fish can say that.</p>
            </div>
            

        <div class="learn-right">
            <h1>Date Safer With Face to Face</h1>
            <p>We’re all eager to meet new people IRL, but dating during COVID-19 means putting your safety first. When six
            feet apart isn’t enough, Face to Face lets you video chat with your match so you can keep the connection
            going online.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="learn-right">
        <h1>Connect With People Everywhere</h1>
        <p>Go beyond your distance settings and chat with people around the world with our Passport™ feature. All it
            takes is an upgrade to a Tinder Plus® subscription to be able to match anywhere from everywhere.</p>
        </div>
    <div class="learn-right">
        <h1>Matches at Your Fingertips</h1>
        <p>One of the most adult decisions you’ll make is picking a dating app that can offer you all the things your ex
            couldn’t. And it’s not just as simple as choosing between Badoo or Zoosk. Meeting people online is a
            journey, and you want someone along for the ride that you can trust. When it comes to making a match,
            consider the Tinder app your new copilot.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="learn-right">
            <h1>All-Inclusive, All the Time</h1>
        <p>We’re not a fan of labels, so we offer a dating experience designed to connect you with new people outside
            your usual circles. Unlike sites like Bumble, Tinder doesn’t filter based on height, education, race, or
            religion because demographics do not define a person. We believe everyone deserves the right to be seen and
            make the first move no matter how they identify. On our app, we put everyone in front of you and let you
            choose who you want to chat with.</p>
